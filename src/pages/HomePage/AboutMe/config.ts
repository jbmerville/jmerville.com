  "Hello, my name is Erik and welcome to my website. I'm currently a 3B (Junior) Software Engineering and Computational Mathemattics Student at the University of Waterloo. I'm also a well-versed Software Engineer with a strong passion for studying financial markets. I'm currently working on an algorithmic trading solution which trades Bitcoin (profitable) and attempts to mimic my strategies for trading currencies and equity index futures. Recently I've wrapped up an internship at Google on the Hotels backend team working as a Big Data Engineer. Prior to Google, I interned as a Backend Engineer at Lumina, the operating system for digital assets. Lumina was then acquired 4 months later. Prior to Lumina, I've attempted to launch my own marketplace startup (failed) and interned two more times as a Mobile Engineer. These days outside of school and programming, my time is spent going to the gym, climbing mountains, driving at night, and listening to trance and trap music (bedroom DJ). Although not as feasible in these times, I really enjoy travelling to unique places and experiencing foreign cultures.";
